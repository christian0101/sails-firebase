  // As of Sails/Waterline v0.10, the 'associations' interface
  // is also available.  If you don't implement 'associations',
  // it will be polyfilled for you by Waterline core.  The core
  // implementation will always be used for cross-adapter / cross-connection
  // joins.
  //
  // In future versions of Sails/Waterline, 'queryable' may be also
  // be polyfilled by core.
  //
  // These polyfilled implementations can usually be further optimized at the
  // adapter level, since most databases provide optimizations for internal
  // operations.
